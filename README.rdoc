== FundMyProject

FundMyProject is a basic Rails app that allows people to fund user created projects!

Make sure you have Ruby on Rails installed. The database has been seeded with dummy data, which you can view in db/seeds.rb. To launch the application, run 'rails s' in the command line in the root directory of this project and go to localhost:3000 in your browser.
